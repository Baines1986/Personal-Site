		<h1>The Impact: Mars in 3 Days, 3DPrinted Human Tissue, Brainwave Education, Memory Crystals & More</h2>
		<p>In this series, I perform a brief dive into some of the innovations and future trends reported within the previous week. The focus... to demonstrate the impact of upcoming technology, highlight future trends and to promote radical innovation.</p>
		<h2>Mars in 3 Days?</h2>
		<p>Recent technological innovation residing around the Space sector has seen the likes of Virgin Galactic, SpaceX and Xcor achieve significant milestones. All in their pursuit of making space tourism a new industry amongst other visions. Yet the likes of Elon Musk, Peter Diamandis and Richard Branson have all spoke in part about the colonisation of our distant planets, which until now (nearly anyway!) has been a one-way trip. NASA's laser propulsion system, utilising photonics, uses particles of light to propel objects through space. The best part... this system uses low amounts of fuel! Naturally, this innovation is huge. The distant, one-way mission to Mars has the potential to become as time-consuming as a trip to the Moon. Potentially driving forward opportunities for colonisation of distant planets, mining of scarce resources and creation of vast new industries. Keep an eye on this one!</p>
		<h2>The Memory Crystal 3,000x the Storage of a MacBook</h2>
		<p>Data Storage and the general capability of our technological devices has exponentially increased in line with Moores Law. Yet we still finding it amazing when something such as the Superman Memory Crystal is announced. To put this innovation simply, the Crystal, which is less than the size of a human finger nail, has the storage capacity of (on average) around 360 times that of a standard laptop hard drive... my MacBook Air only has a 126GB storage drive... the Crystal is ~3,000 times bigger in capacity! Yet around 2% of the physical size. Whilst we may not immediately see this type of innovation to be scalable in terms of possible cost to release, we only have to look towards progressions in Micro Memory and Memristors to realise the potential is there. Whilst the impact leading us to a further vast reduction in weight, size and availability of high-end memory capacities of much of our tech.</p>
		<p>Professor Kazanky of OptoElectronics had the following to say about the progress of the innovation:</p>
		<blockquote>It is thrilling to think that we have created the technology to preserve documents and information and store it in space for future generations. This technology can secure the last evidence of our civilization: all we've learnt will not be forgotten, - Professor Peter Kazansky from the Optoelectronics Research Center.</blockquote>
		<h2>Translation of Sign-Language</h2>
		<p>In the area of bridging the gap between the physical and digital Worlds, there has been a number of neat innovations. Google and Oculus with their VR efforts, LeapMotion with their handheld interactives and Bleen with their Holographic tech. The usage of such technologies, similar to that of LeapMotion to aid the translation of language for those unable to hear or speak is a natural step and extremely good use-case. Essentially, an innovation which breaks down the barriers for those who already face barriers to their communication. Thus, the impact of Myo Gesture Control is life-changing for many of the target market.</p>
		<h2>Gravitational Waves</h2>
		<p>Long have a number of the theories of Einstein been believed, logically correct, yet unable to be scientifically proven... until last week's conclusion of extensive experiments and research! This particular example relating to the effects of a collision of two black holes. On Sept. 14, 2015 at 5:51 a.m. EDT scientists were able to observe a series of gravitational waves following this collision as predicted by Einstein. Not a typical innovation yet a progression in science which opens the door to a further vast understanding of the Cosmos and the way our planetary systems work.</p>
		<p>David Reitze at the LIGO Laboratory had the following the say about the recent observation:</p>
		<blockquote>Our observation of gravitational waves accomplishes an ambitious goal set out over five decades ago to directly detect this elusive phenomenon and better understand the universe, and, fittingly, fulfills Einstein’s legacy on the 100th anniversary of his general theory of relativity - David H. Reitze, executive director of the LIGO Laboratory Supercharging Brain Implants  </blockquote>
		<p>Who would have thought our brains been connected to a Wireless network or transmitting Wireless data would have been a realistic development? Much like an ECU in a vehicle, scientists at the Toyohashi University of Technology have developed a wireless implant to replace the traditional wired versions. They suggest the innovation reduces the risk of infection, whilst offering a less invasive implementation, control and removal procedure thus also lowering the risk of potential damage. So is the era of humanoids really upon us? The next step in this innovation is clearly driven towards medical purposes yet it does make you wonder how long it will take for our minds to be available for download.</p>
		<h2>Education through Brain-Waves  </h2>
		<p>The previous innovation focused on implants which utilise wireless networks to operate. This next innovation interestingly relates directly to a scarily great use-case. Researchers at HRL Laboratories have been able to prove that 'education by brainwaves' can be a successful learning mechanism. In proving their research, HCL Laboratories scanned brain waves of a professional pilot and re-transmitted these waves through a novice pilot. Their findings indicate this type of 'education' works. Naturally unbelievable as it makes you wonder about the 16+ years spent in education which essentially, could of been downloaded over the Internet! Yet another one to keep an eye on.</p>
		<p>Matthew Phillips of HCL Laboratories had the following to say:</p>
		<blockquote>”Pilot skill development requires a synthesis of multiple cognitive faculties, many of which are enhanced by tDCS and include dexterity, mental arithmetic, cognitive flexibility, visuo-spatial reasoning, and working memory” - Matthew Phillips, PhD 3D Printed Human Tissue  </blockquote>
		<p>In the recent years, we have seen 3D Printed Cars, Planes, Food, Prosthetics and many many more use-cases. It was only a matter of time before some geniuses such as those at Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine figure out how to 3D Print Human Tissue. Simply look at the progression in implants and prosthetics and it becomes clear to see that such an advancement is not something that is so out of the ordinary. Yet it is an innovation which has the life-changing capabilities for many of those who have been involved in life-changing accidents or debilitating illnesses. </p>
		<h2>The Real Impact of Automation</h2>
		<p>Long has the media, scientists and organisations alike all spoken of the pending impact of true automation. This is not simply the act of digitization or the replacement of paper with a laptop. This level of automation relates to the impact which more intelligent robotics will have on the World. The report outlines a severe impact which such progressions will have on today's workforce. Yet naturally, the impact fails to investigate the potential new industries which will arise out of robotics. Manufacturing, programming, maintenance. Only a few of many examples of the opportunities which could arise out advanced automation.</p>
		<p>Carl Frey, an Oxford Martin Citi Fellow had the following to say about the impact of automation:</p>
		<blockquote>”The magnitude of the challenge ahead needs to be recognized and an agenda set for policy to address issues such as educational needs, to minimize the negative affect of automation on workers. And it is crucial that this conversation starts now” - Carl Frey, Oxford Martin Citi Fellow </blockquote>
